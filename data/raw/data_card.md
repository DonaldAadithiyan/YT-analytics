# üìÑ Data Card: YouTube Video Metrics Dataset (YouTube Data API v3)

## üßæ Dataset Summary

This dataset is collected using the YouTube Data API v3 and contains metadata and performance metrics for a set of public YouTube videos across various categories and countries. It includes publishing data, channel information, and engagement metrics at two points in time (initial and final logging). Here in this data collection, 1 hour time gap is considered for initial and final logging. It is suitable for video performance analysis, viewership prediction, and content recommendation systems.

## üèÅ Motivation

The dataset was created to study YouTube video performance dynamics over time. It helps answer questions such as:

* How quickly do videos gain views, likes, or comments?
* Are some categories or countries associated with better video performance?
* What is the relationship between a channel's popularity and a video's early traction?

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Data Collection Process

* The dataset is collected automatically using a Python-based tool that interfaces with the YouTube Data API v3.
* A cron job is configured to execute the scraping script every hour throughout the day.
* During each hourly run (e.g., at 08:00), the script fetches all publicly available videos published in the previous hour (i.e., from 07:00 to 08:00).
* Immediately after discovery, an initial logging is performed, capturing:
* Video metadata (e.g., title, tags, category, country)
* Video-level performance metrics (e.g., views, likes, comments)
* Channel-level metadata (e.g., channel title, total views, subscribers)
* One hour later (e.g., at 09:00), a final logging is conducted for the same set of video IDs to observe engagement changes over the 1-hour interval.
* The process allows tracking of short-term performance evolution, helpful for early trend prediction and video growth modeling.
* Video categories are mapped using the standard videoCategoryId definitions provided by YouTube.
* Only public videos from a curated list of targeted countries and categories are included in the dataset.

## ‚úÖ Intended Use

This dataset supports:

* Regression/classification models to predict video popularity
* Category-wise trend analysis
* Country-level content performance studies

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Ethical Considerations

* All data comes from public YouTube metadata, no private user info is used.
* Country codes are based on the default region set in YouTube API.
* No re-distribution of video content or thumbnails.
* Use responsibly, respecting YouTube's [Terms of Service](https://www.youtube.com/t/terms).
